# Getting Started
## Account Registration
First things, first: registering your account! Using the Labs platform is free to all users for most features but does require a handful of things in order to make those features available to you.

### Linking your GitHub Account
During registration you will be asked to link your GitHub account. While this isn't strictly required to use the platform, many features will be unavailable until you do this as the platform relies on GitHub for project storage and version control. We have further integrations planned (GitLab, BitBucket, Radicle, etc) but as of now, you'll want to have a GitHub account (free tier is more than sufficient) in order to maximize the usefulness of our platform.

### Email Confirmation
Immediately following the registration of your account, you will be emailed at the email address you used to register. Please find that email and click the confirmation link to verify ownership of your email address.

### Adding a Payment Method
Lastly, you'll need to add a payment method to your Labs account even if you are on the free tier. This allows a la carte execution of models on our execution cluster and also enables protections against abusive or malicious accounts being created. Adding a payment method *does not* sign you up for anything nor will those payment methods ever be charged without explicit confirmation on your part before hand.
