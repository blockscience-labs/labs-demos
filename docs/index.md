# Welcome
Welcome to the BlockScience Labs platform! This docsite will serve as your one-stop shop for all things Labs.

## Introduction to Labs
The Labs platform brings together a collection of modeling tools and services to faciliate the entire modeling pipeline from the early planning and diagramming phase to the post-processing and analytics phase and, finally, to the presentation phase.

This site is structured like a book and is intended to be read through from beginning to end in sequential order which each section building on the content of those prior. Having said that, you should be fine skipping around to only the parts that are particularly relevant to your specific needs.
